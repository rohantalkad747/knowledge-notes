If haha.sh contains:

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "FROM = $1"
    echo "TO   = $2"

Then, executing:

    python ranges.py 2017-01-01 2019-11-26 | xargs -L 1 ~/haha.sh


We'll get:

    FROM = 2017-01-01
    TO   = 2017-01-31
    FROM = 2017-02-01
    TO   = 2017-02-28
    FROM = 2017-03-01
    TO   = 2017-03-31
    ...
    FROM = 2019-11-01
    TO   = 2019-11-26
