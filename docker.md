Docker Storage drivers:
- Device mapper (Fedora): devicemapper
 
==> thin provisioning and snapshotting capabilities
==> alternative to AUFS

==> stores every image and container on its own virtual device
   ==> thin-provisioned copy-on-write snapshot devices
   ==> works at the block level rather than the file level
